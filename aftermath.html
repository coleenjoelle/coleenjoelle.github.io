      <h1>What happens after you Graduate?</h1>
      <h2>Aftermath</h2>
      <p>AfterMath is a great opportunity for current SMC students to learn from a panel of recent Math Department graduates what it's like out in the "real world" with regard to jobs, internships, graduate school, and more. In 2009, the Math Department was pleased to offer AfterMath in both the spring and the fall semesters. The Mathematics Department offers AfterMath to provide students with first-hand information on opportunities available to its majors. We express appreciation to our distinguished alumnae, without whose generosity this program would not be possible. These career women voluntarily give up their weekend and return to Saint Mary’s, thus returning to their successors an opportunity afforded them.</p>
      <h2>Masters in Data Science</h2>
      <p>Saint Mary's College offers graduates who possess a A bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited school (or international equivalent) in mathematics, business, computer science, information systems, the sciences, health science, quantitative social science or related field or relevant work experience the oppertunity to get their Masters in Data Science. Finishing this program will take five to six semesters over the course of two years, with summer courses included. You will need a total of 36 credits, which include 24 core cxourse credits, at least three practicum credits, at least six electives credits, three additional credits in electives or practicum experiences, and a practicum presentation. Due to this program being online and asynchronus you will also be required to make one short visit to our lovely campus each year.</p>
