      <h2>Engineering/ITREDS</h2>
      <p>This program trains undergraduate students at the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary&#39;s College in data science. This is a two-year program aimed to educate through the 15-credit program. iTREDS scholars develop an in-depth data science background as well as communication, critical thinking, teamwork, and other skills necessary for professional development. </p>
      <p> At Saint Mary’s, our graduates are prepared to be leaders in their fields. They are women of action. With a growing demand for women in STEM fields, you will get the preparation you need to be a leader in male-dominated areas. Here, you can choose from one of the department’s four majors or pair your major with the Five-Year Dual Degree in Engineering Program at the University of Notre Dame. You can choose from aerospace, chemical, civil, computer science, electrical, environmental geoscience, or mechanical engineering. </p>
      <p> The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science offers a unique Master of Science in Data Science degree. There is a special 4+1 option offered to Saint Mary's undergraduates, which allows you to begin taking graduate level classes in your senior year to receive your graduate degree with just one addition year of study. You'll expand on your undergraduate coursework to develop a strong quantitative base — an enduring skill set in an ever-changing world — that will allow you to take on complex data challenges now and in the future. </p>
