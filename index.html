        <h2>Mathematics</h2>
        <p>The study of mathematics has occupied humans from ancient times to the present. It is an intellectual process requiring creativity, analysis, logic, decision-making, synthesis of ideas, and communication. Mathematics exists in and for itself but also provides the technical basis for problem-solving in a wide variety of fields. Saint Maryâ€™s graduates equipped with a strong mathematical background will be in the enviable position of being able to utilize their expertise in areas where rigorous thought and precision of results are necessary. The courses in mathematics are offered for those studying the subject as part of a liberal education; for majors as a preparation for graduate studies, careers in business, or industry; and for those who intend to teach mathematics. In addition to the Major in Mathematics, we offer four tracks for those with special interests. The Statistics and Actuarial Mathematics Major is a sequence of courses giving the student experience in statistics with an emphasis on risk modeling and is recognized by the Society of Actuaries as a pre-actuarial program. The Computing and Applied Mathematics Major enables those students with a strong interest in computer science to pursue an integrated program of mathematics and computer science. Similarly, the Physics and Applied Mathematics Major enables those students with interests in physics and mathematics to pursue both. The Mathematics Major with Teacher Concentration enables the student to obtain secondary school certification in the State of Indiana. </p>

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <p>Courses in computer science are designed to educate students of the liberal arts in computer literacy; to provide computer programming instruction for students of mathematics, science, business and social science; and to establish a solid foundation in computer software theory and practice for students of all disciplines. The courses are taught by the Mathematics Department. The College offers a major in Computing and Applied Mathematics that combines mathematics and computer science (see Mathematics), a concentration in Management Information Systems within the Business Administration major (see Business Administration and Economics), and a minor outlined <a href="majors.html">here</a>. </p>
